This Web App is a fun project that i called "window" because each option opens a "window" to an animation that i created for fun. You can choose between an **starfield**, **bubbles** (with fish) and **rain**.

To Do:
 - Make that the fish can eat
    - Create food class
        - Food can be poisonous or make the fish faster or slower
        - Food fall down until it reaches the botton and appears on top again in another spot and different parameters
